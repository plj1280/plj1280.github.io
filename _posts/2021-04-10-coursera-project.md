title: Determining the Optimal Location for a new Chipotle Restaurant in Queens, NY
---
## Introduction
For my capstone project for the IBM Data Science Certification, I used demographic data from the US Census Bureau and venue data from Foursquare to try to determine attractive candidate locations for a new Chipotle restaurant.
In this post, I'll discuss the data sources I used and the analysis I did. But mainly, I'll show off the cool interactive maps I made.
For more details, check out this <Jupyter notebook> that contains all the steps of data processing, analysis, and visualization, and this <formal report> version of the results.
